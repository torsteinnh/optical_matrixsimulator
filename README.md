# Specialization and master project: modeling of surface plasmons

This repository contains the source code for a surface plasmon simulator developed for a potential hydrogen sensor.
The development of the software started for my specialization project at NTNU, please se the project report for documentation of the core systems.
It was later expanded as part of my master thesis, please se the thesis for documentation on the expanded features.
